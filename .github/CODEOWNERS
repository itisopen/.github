# Use this file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

# Order is important: the last matching pattern has the highest precedence

# To allow mergify to auto-merge, we must in general not assign code owners to files
# This is because mergify will not be able to merge if the code owner is not a mergify admin.
# Instead, we require mergify checks to pass before merging and re-implement CODEOWNERS 
# functionality in the mergify configuration.

## These owners will be the default owners for everything
